# 👋 Hi, I'm Manu Sai

I’m a passionate software developer who loves building things that live on the internet and actually help people. I enjoy turning ideas into clean, simple, and meaningful digital experiences.

I’m someone who learns by doing — experimenting, breaking things, fixing them, and improving every day. I care deeply about writing quality code, creating smooth user experiences, and constantly growing as a developer and as a person.

## 💡 What drives me

I enjoy challenges that push me outside my comfort zone. Whether it’s learning a new concept, improving an existing project, or starting something from scratch, I believe progress comes from curiosity, discipline, and persistence.
